### Introduction
In the real estate market, accurate pricing of houses is crucial for both buyers and sellers. Predicting housing prices helps potential investors and buyers make informed decisions. This project aims to predict house prices based on historical data using various machine learning techniques.

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes various features related to residential properties:
  - Square Footage
  - Number of Bedrooms
  - Number of Bathrooms
  - Number of Floors
  - Lot Size
  - View Quality
Each row in the dataset epresents a house, and the target variable is the Sale Price.

### Objective
The primary objective is to build a model that can:
  - Accurately predict the selling price of houses given a set of features.
  - Analyze the impact of different features on housing prices

### Conclusion
The final model provides a reasonably accurate prediction of house prices. By analyzing key features, the model offers insights into which property attributes influence pricing the most.
